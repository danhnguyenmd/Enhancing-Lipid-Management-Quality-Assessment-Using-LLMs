Statin medications include atorvastatin (Lipitor), rosuvastatin (Crestor), simvastatin (Zocor), pravastatin (Pravachol), lovastatin (Mevacor, Altoprev), pitavastatin (Livalo, Zypitamag), and fluvastatin (Lescol). High-intensity statins are atorvastatin (Lipitor) 40-80 mg daily and rosuvastatin (Crestor) 20-40 mg daily. 

# Instructions
1. Determine whether the patient has taken at least two different statins, including any current therapy. Record Yes or No in 'Two Statins Tried'.

3. Briefly explain your determination in 'Statins Tried Reasoning', citing specific findings from the notes and what specific statins the patients has tried.
